# Getting Started with Python

To run the **Python examples**, you need to have the corresponding **CSi Software** installed (e.g., SAP2000, ETABS, SAFE, CSiBridge, Perform 3D). Additionally, you will need to set up the required Python environment and dependencies.

### **Python Installation**

Ensure that you have **Python 3.9** installed, as this is the recommended version for compatibility. If you do not have Python installed, follow these steps:

#### Installation Steps:

1. **Download Python 3.9**:

   - Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/).
   - Download the **Python 3.9 installer** for your operating system.

2. **Install Python**:

   - Run the installer and make sure to check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** before proceeding.

3. **Verify the Installation in Visual Studio Code**:

   - Open **Visual Studio Code** and press Ctrl+\` (or Cmd+\` on macOS) to open the integrated terminal.
   - Type the following command:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - If Python is installed correctly, you should see output similar to:
     ```bash
     Python 3.9.x
     ```
   - If Python is not installed or the command is not recognized, you'll need to install it.

4. **Install Python Extension in Visual Studio Code**:

   - Open **Visual Studio Code** and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
   - Search for the **Python extension** by Microsoft and install it.
   - This extension provides support for linting, debugging, IntelliSense, and running Python code directly from VS Code.

Now you're all set up to run the Python examples within Visual Studio Code!
