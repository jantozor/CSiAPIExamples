## **Requirements for IronPython Examples**

In addition to having the corresponding **CSi Software** (e.g., SAP2000, ETABS, SAFE, CSiBridge, Perform3D) installed, the **IronPython Examples** require `IronPython` for interacting with .NET-based APIs.

### 1. **Install IronPython**
IronPython is a .NET implementation of Python, enabling seamless integration with .NET libraries and COM automation.
#### Installation Steps:

1. Download IronPython from the official website:

   - Visit the official [IronPython website](https://ironpython.net/download/).
   - Download the **IronPython 3.4 installer**.
2. Verify the installation folder with the settings.json file on the .vscode folder.

If IronPython is installed correctly, the following path should exist `C:\Program Files\IronPython 3.4\ipy.exe`.
