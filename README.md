## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- **CSiAmerica Software**: Ensure you have a valid installation of supported CSiAmerica software (e.g., SAP2000, ETABS, SAFE, CSiBridge, Perform3D).
- **Programming Language**: Knowledge of the programming language supported by the API (Python, Visual Basic, C#, C++, MATLAB).
- **Development Environment**:
  - We recommend using **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** for running and debugging the provided examples.


### **Installing Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code**

#### **Visual Studio Code**
1. Download **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** from the official site: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### **Installing Visual Studio (For C#, Visual Basic, and C++)**
1. Download **Visual Studio** from [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
2. During the installation process, youâ€™ll need to select the following workloads:
   - **.NET desktop development**: For coding in **C#** and **Visual Basic**.
   - **Desktop development with C++**: For coding in **C++**.
3. After installation, Visual Studio will have the necessary compilers and libraries for **C#**, **Visual Basic**, and **C++** development.

### **Installation**
