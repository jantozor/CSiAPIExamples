## Requirements for Visual Basic, Framework 4.8, and .NET 8 Examples

In addition to having the corresponding **CSi Software** installed (e.g., SAP2000, ETABS, SAFE, CSiBridge, Perform 3D), the examples provided for **Visual Basic**, **Framework 4.8**, and **.NET 8** require specific software components.

### 1. **.NET Framework 4.8**
   For the **.NET Framework** examples, **.NET Framework 4.8** is required. If you do not have it installed, follow these steps to install it:

   #### Installation Steps:
   1. **Download the .NET Framework 4.8**:
      - Visit the official [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).
      - Select the version for your system (e.g., **.NET Framework 4.8**).
   
   2. **Run the Installer**:
      - After downloading, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   
   3. **Verify the Installation**:
      - After installation, you can verify that **.NET Framework 4.8** is installed by going to **Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Programs and Features** and checking the list for **.NET Framework 4.8**.

### 2. **.NET 8**
   For the **.NET** examples, **.NET 8** is required. If you need to install it, follow these steps:

   #### Installation Steps:
   1. **Download .NET 8 SDK**:
      - Go to the official [Microsoft .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) and download the **.NET 8 SDK** for your platform.
   
   2. **Run the Installer**:
      - Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the instructions. You may need to restart your system after installation.
   
   3. **Verify the Installation**:
      - After installation, open a command prompt or terminal and type the following command to verify the installation:
        ```bash
        dotnet --version
        ```
      - This should output the version number, confirming that **.NET 8** is successfully installed.

### 3. **Framework and .NET Compatibility**
   - Ensure that your development environment is set up with the correct version of **.NET Framework 4.8** or **.NET 8**, depending on the example you are running.
   - You can check your **Visual Studio** version to ensure compatibility with **.NET 4.8** and **.NET 8**.

By ensuring that both the **CSi Software** and the required **.NET Frameworks** are installed, you will be able to use the provided examples effectively.
